      <h1>My First CI/CD Job</h1>
      <p>
        We have sucessfully deployed our application from githup to our
        NFS_SERVER without connecting to either the web_severs or the
        NFS_Server.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subsequently, we don't even have to log into jenkins as the job
        has been configured to run whenever the developers make a change
        to the source code.
